This is my rudimentary game engine project for playing around with ECS, currently with a fairly simple and na√Øve implementation.

Next steps at the ECS level are to add ways to query components and schedule updates in a proper way.

Next steps at the game level are to actually make a game that's not just some simple objects falling with a hard-coded update.
